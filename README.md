# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Amazon Vine Analysis project analyzes Amazon reviews that are written by members of the paid/unpaid Amazon Vine program. We perform the ETL process by using PySpark, AWS RDS instance, and pgAdmin to analyze the reviews of special product: software. Our goal is to determin if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in our dataset.

## Results

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
